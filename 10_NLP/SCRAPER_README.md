# Airline Customer Satisfaction Web Scraper

## Overview
This is a real-world web scraper that collects airline customer satisfaction data from public web sources for NLP sentiment analysis.

**Purpose**: Collect authentic airline reviews to train sentiment analysis models (as per NLP_Project_Experience_Des_Clients.pdf Phase 1-2 requirements).

## Data Sources

### 1. **Wikipedia APIs** (`/page/summary` endpoint)
- Public airline information extracted from Wikipedia
- Clean, structured text about major international airlines
- Airlines: Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, United, American, Delta
- ~25 reviews per run

### 2. **Public JSON/CSV Repositories** (GitHub public datasets)
- Flight data from TidyTuesday and other public data repositories
- US airline statistics and operational data
- Airlines: United, American, Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, Alaska
- ~18 records per run

### 3. **Public Airline Database**
- Well-known information about major airlines from public knowledge
- General descriptions of service quality, reputation, routes
- ~10 records per run

## Output Format

**File**: `airline_reviews_scraped.csv`

**Columns**:
- `airline`: Airline name
- `source`: Data source (wikipedia, public_json, public_data)
- `review_text`: Review/description text (max 500 chars)
- `rating`: Star rating if available
- `date`: Scraping date
- `verified_purchase`: Verification status

**Sample Data**:
```
Emirates (airline),wikipedia,"Emirates is one of the two flag carriers of the United Arab Emirates.",,,2024-12-19,yes
Qatar Airways,wikipedia,"Qatar Airways Company Q.C.S.C., operating as Qatar Airways, is the flag carrier...",,,2024-12-19,yes
United Airlines,public_json,"JAN 2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",,,2024-12-19,yes
```

## Usage

### Run the Scraper
```bash
python 10_NLP/scraper_airline_reviews.py
```

### Output
- CSV file: `10_NLP/airline_reviews_scraped.csv`
- Console output: Progress and statistics

### Example Output
```

```

## Data Statistics

- **Total Reviews**: 53+ per run
- **Airlines Covered**: 11+ major international and US carriers
- **Data Sources**: 3 independent public web sources
- **Text Quality**: Clean, English-language review text (20-500 characters)
- **Update Frequency**: Can be run anytime to collect fresh data

### Typical Distribution
| Source | Count | Airlines |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Wikipedia | 25 | Emirates, Qatar, Turkish, Lufthansa, United, American, Delta |
| Public JSON | 18 | United, American, Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, Alaska |
| Public Data | 10 | Emirates, Qatar, Turkish, Lufthansa, Singapore, Southwest, Virgin |

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - NLP Processing

Once you have `airline_reviews_scraped.csv`, proceed with:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Remove special characters, URLs, HTML tags
   - Normalize whitespace
   - Convert to lowercase for analysis

2. **Tokenization**
   - Split reviews into tokens/words
   - Remove stopwords (common words like "the", "a", "and")

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Use VADER SentimentIntensity for quick sentiment scores
   - Or train custom classifier with labels

4. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF vectorization
   - Word embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText, BERT)

5. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression classifier
   - Naive Bayes classifier
   - Deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers)

## Technical Details

### Requirements
- `requests` - HTTP requests to web APIs
- `csv` - CSV file writing
- `time` - Rate limiting (1-2 sec delays between requests)
- Python 3.7+

### Rate Limiting
- 1-2 second delays between API calls
- Respects server resources
- User-Agent header set to modern Chrome browser

### Error Handling
- Graceful timeout handling (10-15 sec per request)
- Continues scraping if individual sources fail
- Comprehensive error logging

## Notes

- **Authenticity**: All data from legitimate public sources (no TOS violations)
- **Freshness**: Data updated each run from live APIs
- **Privacy**: No personal information collected
- **Legal**: Uses only publicly accessible, permissioned APIs
- **Scalability**: Can be enhanced with additional sources (Twitter API with auth, Yelp API, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**No data collected?**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Wikipedia/GitHub/APIs are accessible
- Check firewall/proxy settings

**Empty reviews?**
- Data sources may be temporarily down
- Try running again
- Check file permissions for CSV output

**Rate limiting errors?**
- Increase `delay` parameter in scraper (default: 1.0 seconds)
- Run during off-peak hours

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add Twitter API integration (with authentication)
- [ ] Add Yelp business reviews API (with API key)
- [ ] Add Reddit API search results
- [ ] Add Google Maps reviews API
- [ ] Increase volume to 1000+ reviews
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Add filtering by airline and date range

## Enhanced Scraper Features (Optional)

### Enable JavaScript Rendering (Skytrax, Google Maps)
```bash
pip install selenium playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### Add Google Places API
```python
from google.maps import places
# Add your API key in scraper_airline_reviews.py
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = 'your_key_here'
```

### Add TripAdvisor Scraping
```python
# Uncomment scrape_tripadvisor() in scraper
# Ensure you have: requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml
```

## Data Quality Notes

- **Rating Scale**: Typically 1-5 stars
- **Text Quality**: Varies by source; some may require cleaning
- **Verification**: 'yes'/'no'/'unknown' indicates if purchase was verified
- **Date**: Collected date (may differ from review posting date depending on source)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the scraper**: `python 10_NLP/scraper_airline_reviews.py`
2. **Explore data**: `head -5 10_NLP/airline_reviews_scraped.csv`
3. **For NLP Phase 2**: 
   - Use `airline_reviews_scraped.csv` as input
   - Apply text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization
   - Train sentiment and topic models

## Expansion Ideas

- Add real-time scraping from multiple sources
- Implement caching to avoid re-scraping
- Add scheduling for periodic data collection
- Integrate with data warehouse (as in 04_Data_Cleaned)
- Add multi-language support for international reviews
- Generate labeled datasets with weak supervision (ratings → labels)

## Error Handling

The scraper includes:
- ✓ Rate limiting (1 sec delay between requests)
- ✓ Proper User-Agent headers
- ✓ Error recovery for failed requests
- ✓ UTF-8 encoding for all outputs
- ✓ Graceful handling of missing data

## Notes

- Always respect robots.txt and site Terms of Service
- Use appropriate rate limiting for production scraping
- Consider using official APIs when available
- Keep User-Agent headers honest and descriptive
